# 🎉 Image Upload Issue - FIXED

## ✅ Issue Resolution Complete

The image upload functionality in the Local Artisan Ally application has been successfully fixed and is now working properly.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

**Problem**: The "Add Image" button in the Sell Your Art page was only adding placeholder images instead of allowing users to upload their own product photos.

**Solution**: Completely rewrote the image upload functionality to support actual file selection with proper validation.

## 🌟 Key Improvements

1. **Real File Upload**: Users can now select images from their device
2. **File Validation**: 
   - Only image files accepted (JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc.)
   - Maximum file size: 5MB
3. **Image Preview**: Instant preview of uploaded images
4. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for invalid files
5. **Multiple Images**: Support for up to 5 product images

## 📁 Technical Implementation

- **File Type**: Accepts all image formats (`image/*`)
- **Storage**: Base64 data URLs for client-side storage
- **Validation**: Client-side validation for file type and size
- **User Experience**: Toast notifications for feedback

## ✅ Verification Status

- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Application builds without errors
- ✅ Local server running with updated functionality
- ✅ All existing features still working

## 🚀 How to Test

2. Fill in product details
3. Click "Add Image" button
4. Select an image file from your device
