# AI Service Setup Instructions

## Current Status
âœ… **AI Service is now working with fallback responses!**

The AI analysis should now work without any additional setup. The system will provide intelligent fallbacks when the Hugging Face API is not configured.

## Optional: Enable Full AI Capabilities

To get the full AI-powered analysis using Hugging Face models, follow these steps:

### 1. Get a Free Hugging Face API Token
1. Go to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co)
2. Create a free account (if you don't have one)
3. Go to [Settings > Access Tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens)
4. Click "New token"
5. Choose "Read" permissions (free)
6. Copy your token

### 2. Configure the Environment
1. Open the `.env` file in the project root
2. Replace `your_hugging_face_token_here` with your actual token:
   ```
   VITE_HF_API_TOKEN=hf_your_actual_token_here
   ```
3. Save the file

### 3. Restart the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```
