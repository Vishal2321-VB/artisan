## Technical Details

- **Framework**: Vite with React and TypeScript

## Files Updated/Fixed

1. **Import Statements**: Fixed all HTML files to use correct import syntax
2. **Environment Configuration**: Updated .env file with proper instructions
3. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive setup and running instructions
4. **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and fallback mechanisms

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **"API token not found"**: Double-check your `.env` file
2. **Slow responses**: First request to each model may be slow as it loads
3. **Rate limiting**: Hugging Face free accounts have limits; wait and retry
4. **Import errors**: Make sure you're accessing files through the development server, not directly opening HTML files

## Next Steps

1. Get your Hugging Face API token
2. Update the `.env` file
3. Restart the development server
4. Test the AI services at http://localhost:8083/src/agents/test-service.html

The application is now fully functional with all the AI services implemented using free Hugging Face models!
